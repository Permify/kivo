For information on how many CC rules you can have per account, see [Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html) in the *Developer Guide*.\n There are two types of rules: *Managed Rules* and *Custom Rules*. You can use the ``ConfigRule`` resource to create both CC Managed Rules and CC Custom Rules.\n CC Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by CC. For a list of managed rules, see [List of Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html). If you are adding an CC managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier for the ``SourceIdentifier`` key.\n CC Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are two ways to create CC custom rules: with Lambda functions ([Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function)) and with CFNGUARDshort ([Guard GitHub Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)), a policy-as-code language. CC custom rules created with LAMlong are called *Custom Lambda Rules* and CC custom rules created with CFNGUARDshort are called *Custom Policy Rules*.\n If you are adding a new CC Custom LAM rule, you first need to create an LAMlong function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When you use the ``ConfigRule`` resource to add a Custom LAM rule to CC, you must specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that LAMlong assigns to the function. You specify the ARN in the ``SourceIdentifier`` key. This key is part of the ``Source`` object, which is part of the ``ConfigRule`` object. \n For any new CC rule that you add, specify the ``ConfigRuleName`` in the ``ConfigRule`` object. Do not specify the ``ConfigRuleArn`` or the ``ConfigRuleId``. These values are generated by CC for new rules.\n If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by ``ConfigRuleName``, ``ConfigRuleId``, or ``ConfigRuleArn`` in the ``ConfigRule`` data type that you use in this request.\n For more information about developing and using CC rules, see [Evaluating Resources with Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html) in the *Developer Guide*."

However, if your template includes multiple DDB tables with indexes, you must declare dependencies so that the tables are created sequentially. DDBlong limits the number of tables with secondary indexes that are in the creating state. If you create multiple tables with indexes at the same time, DDB returns an error and the stack operation fails. For an example, see [DynamoDB Table with a DependsOn Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html#aws-resource-dynamodb-table--examples--DynamoDB_Table_with_a_DependsOn_Attribute).\n  \n   Our guidance is to use the latest schema documented for your CFNlong templates. This schema supports the provisioning of all table settings below. When using this schema in your CFNlong templates, please ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are updated with appropriate permissions to allow for the authorization of these setting changes."

  "description": "The AWS::IoTEvents::DetectorModel resource creates a detector model. You create a *detector model* (a model of your equipment or process) using *states*. For each state, you define conditional (Boolean) logic that evaluates the incoming inputs to detect significant events. When an event is detected, it can change the state or trigger custom-built or predefined actions using other AWS services. You can define additional events that trigger actions when entering or exiting a state and, optionally, when a condition is met. For more information, see [How to Use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/developerguide/how-to-use-iotevents.html) in the *Developer Guide*.\n  When you successfully update a detector model (using the ITE console, ITE API or CLI commands, or CFN) all detector instances created by the model are reset to their initial states. (The detector's ``state``, and the values of any variables and timers are reset.)\n When you successfully update a detector model (using the ITE console, ITE API or CLI commands, or CFN) the version number of the detector model is incremented. (A detector model with version number 1 before the update has version number 2 after the update succeeds.)\n If you attempt to update a detector model using CFN and the update does not succeed, the system may, in some cases, restore the original detector model. When this occurs, the detector model's version is incremented twice (for example, from version 1 to version 3) and the detector instances are reset.\n Also, be aware that if you attempt to update several detector models at once using CFN, some updates may succeed and others fail. In this case, the effects on each detector model's detector instances and version number depend on whether the update succeeded or failed, with the results as stated."

For details, see [ABAC for](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html) in the *Developer Guide*.\n  Using an alias to refer to a KMS key can help you simplify key management. For example, an alias in your code can be associated with different KMS keys in different AWS-Regions. For more information, see [Using aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html) in the *Developer Guide*.\n When specifying an alias, observe the following rules.\n  +  Each alias is associated with one KMS key, but multiple aliases can be associated with the same KMS key.\n  +  The alias and its associated KMS key must be in the same AWS-account and Region.\n  +  The alias name must be unique in the AWS-account and Region.

You can use ``AWS::KMS::Key`` to create [multi-Region primary keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-primary-key) of all supported types. To replicate a multi-Region key, use the ``AWS::KMS::ReplicaKey`` resource.\n  If you change the value of the ``KeySpec``, ``KeyUsage``, ``Origin``, or ``MultiRegion`` properties of an existing KMS key, the update request fails, regardless of the value of the [UpdateReplacePolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html). This prevents you from accidentally deleting a KMS key by changing any of its immutable property values.\n    KMS replaced the term *customer master key (CMK)* with ** and *KMS key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.\n  You can use symmetric encryption KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are more commonly used to generate data keys and data key pairs. You can also use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt data stored in AWS services that are [integrated with](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//kms/features/#AWS_Service_Integration). For more information, see [Symmetric encryption KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#symmetric-cmks) in the *Developer Guide*.\n You can use asymmetric KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt data or sign messages and verify signatures. To create an asymmetric key, you must specify an asymmetric ``KeySpec`` value and a ``KeyUsage`` value. For details, see [Asymmetric keys in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the *Developer Guide*.\n You can use HMAC KMS keys (which are also symmetric keys) to generate and verify hash-based message authentication codes. To create an HMAC key, you must specify an HMAC ``KeySpec`` value and a ``KeyUsage`` value of ``GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC``. For details, see [HMAC keys in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html) in the *Developer Guide*.\n You can also create symmetric encryption, asymmetric, and HMAC multi-Region primary keys.

  "name": "AWS::Lambda::Function",
  "description": "The ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resource creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html) and an [execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html). The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.\n You set the package type to ``Image`` if the deployment package is a [container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html). For these functions, include the URI of the container image in the ECR registry in the [ImageUri property of the Code property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html#cfn-lambda-function-code-imageuri). You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties. \n You set the package type to ``Zip`` if the deployment package is a [.zip file archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip). For these functions, specify the S3 location of your .zip file in the ``Code`` property. Alternatively, for Node.js and Python functions, you can define your function inline in the [ZipFile property of the Code property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html#cfn-lambda-function-code-zipfile). In both cases, you must also specify the handler and runtime properties.\n You can use [code signing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html) if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with ``UpdateFunctionCode``, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.\n When you update a ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resource, CFNshort calls the [UpdateFunctionConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_UpdateFunctionConfiguration.html) and [UpdateFunctionCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_UpdateFunctionCode.html) LAM APIs under the hood. Because these calls happen sequentially, and invocations can happen between these calls, your function may encounter errors in the time between the calls. For example, if you remove an environment variable, and the code that references that environment variable in the same CFNshort update, you may see invocation errors related to a missing environment variable. To work around this, you can invoke your function against a version or alias by default, rather than the ``$LATEST`` version.\n Note that you configure [provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html) on a ``AWS::Lambda::Version`` or a ``AWS::Lambda::Alias``.\n For a complete introduction to Lambda functions, see [What is Lambda?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-welcome.html) in the *Lambda developer guide.*"

If you don't, you lose the data when AWS CloudFormation replaces your DB cluster. To preserve your data, perform the following procedure:\n  1.  Deactivate any applications that are using the DB cluster so that there's no activity on the DB instance.\n  1.  Create a snapshot of the DB cluster. For more information, see [Creating a DB cluster snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshotCluster.html).\n  1.  If you want to restore your DB cluster using a DB cluster snapshot, modify the updated template with your DB cluster changes and add the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property with the ID of the DB cluster snapshot that you want to use.\n After you restore a DB cluster with a ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the DB cluster snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB cluster is restored from the specified ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB cluster is deleted.\n  1.  Update the stack.\n  \n  Currently, when you are updating the stack for an Aurora Serverless DB cluster, you can't include changes to any other properties when you specify one of the following properties: ``PreferredBackupWindow``, ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow``, and ``Port``. This limitation doesn't apply to provisioned DB clusters.\n For more information about updating other properties of this resource, see ``ModifyDBCluster``. For more information about updating stacks, see [CloudFormation Stacks Updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html).\n  *Deleting DB clusters* \n The default ``DeletionPolicy`` for ``AWS::RDS::DBCluster`` resources is ``Snapshot``.

However, it retains manual DB snapshots. During an update that requires replacement, you can apply a stack policy to prevent DB instances from being replaced. For more information, see [Prevent Updates to Stack Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html).\n   *Updating DB instances* \n When properties labeled \"*Update requires:* [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)\" are updated, AWS CloudFormation first creates a replacement DB instance, then changes references from other dependent resources to point to the replacement DB instance, and finally deletes the old DB instance.\n  We highly recommend that you take a snapshot of the database before updating the stack.

For Amazon RDS DB instances, you can choose to *retain* the DB instance, to *delete* the DB instance, or to *create a snapshot* of the DB instance. The default AWS CloudFormation behavior depends on the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` property:\n  1.  For ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` resources that don't specify the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation saves a snapshot of the DB instance.\n  1.   For ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` resources that do specify the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation deletes the DB instance.\n  \n  For more information, see [DeletionPolicy Attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html)."

You create records in a public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs). \n  You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource record sets.\n  For more information about charges for hosted zones, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/).\n Note the following:\n  +  You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com.\n  +  If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS service for the domain. For more information, see [Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*. \n  \n When you submit a ``CreateHostedZone`` request, the initial status of the hosted zone is ``PENDING``. For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to ``INSYNC``.\n The ``CreateHostedZone`` request requires the caller to have an ``ec2:DescribeVpcs`` permission.\n  When creating private hosted zones, the Amazon VPC must belong to the same partition where the hosted zone is created. A partition is a group of AWS-Regions. Each AWS-account is scoped to one partition.\n The following are the supported partitions:\n  +   ``aws`` - AWS-Regions \n  +   ``aws-cn`` - China Regions\n  +   ``aws-us-gov`` - govcloud-us-region \n  \n For more information, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *General Reference*."
